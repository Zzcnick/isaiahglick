  Today I had breakfast at my cousin's house, they had bagels and cream cheese. We head back into the city to meet up with my family to see Star Wars The Force Awakens for the second time, for me! I loved it just as much as the first time, if not more! It's an almost perfect movie. It's "almost" perfect because there were no Imperial victories and the Death Star is back and bigger than ever! George Lucas says the movie is too "retro" there are not many new ships for the Imperial army and Resistance.  Meanwhile, my sister and other cousin Minna were on a tourism whirlwind around SF including a double decker bus and carousel and A LOT of treats.

  Then, we all met up again and went to North Beach for an amazing Italian dinner.
