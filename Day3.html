Next day we got up very early for a big day! We were meeting our cousins at the Cal Academy of Sciences, it is like the American Museum of Natural History but smaller and more interactive. It's Christmas Eve but since we are Jewish, it's no big deal. We drove over to the academy. It took a long time to find a parking spot, but we finally got one. Than, we walked into the museum. First, we saw the rainforest exhibit. It was connected to a water exhibit, which we saw next. Than, we saw an awesome exhibit about earthquakes. It had a cool movie, but we were worried that maybe a quake would hit San Francisco - right on the fault line!

  We ended the day at one of the few restaurants that were open on Christmas Eve! Even better, they had sushi!
