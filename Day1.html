  My family and I left New York early in the morning. We arrived into the airport (Newark) and checked our bags. It was not a long line, so we were quickly scanned and sat down at the gate. I watched <i>Star Wars Attack of the Clones</i> (Awesome!!!!!!). Than we got onboard at a gate. Once the plane took flight, I fell asleep almost at once. Soon, we arrived at the San Fransisco airport. It was 2:00 o clock. We could have spent a whole day doing stuff, but we decided to rest. Once we arrived at the hotel, my grandma left for my cousins house in Berkeley. We settled in and relaxed, had dinner at the hotel. Finally, we went to bed early (SF time!).
