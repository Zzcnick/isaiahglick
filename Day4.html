  Big day! We have tickets to the Christmas Day game at Oracle Stadium - the Golden State Warriors Vs the Cleveland Cavaliers! LeBron VS Curry! We picked up my cousin Ari and went over to the stadium in Oakland. The lines were really long but we finally got in, and the seats were amazing! So close to the court - you could see EVERYTHING! The game was great too - super close the whole time. I got a jersey. My cousin and I had a great time cheering for the Warriors and they WON! Also, Ari and I wore the shirts they handed out at the door. We had the best time!  Christmas at the game was awesome! It was even better than the NBA championships! I wish my cousin lived in New York, but this was much better than any KNICKS game lately!

After the game, I had a sleepover at Ariâ€™s house - it was super fun, a lot of legos!!
